# Modal_Line_Width
When the nonlinear interaction occurs inside a cavity, the cavity characteristics need to be considered. 
In this case, the SPDC phase-matching linewidth, 𝛿𝜈, forms an envelope that is composed of 𝑚 modes separated by the free spectral range, 
𝛥𝑓, of the cavity. The narrow mode linewidths, 𝛿𝜈, are determined by the length of the cavity and the losses from the cavity.

In this work, a calculation was made using the materials of the manuscript:
